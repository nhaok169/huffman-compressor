Huang Wenxiu
Good afternoon, esteemed members of the English Club. Today, I stand before you to share the profound influence that Huang Wenxiu has had on my life. Her remarkable journey from a graduate of Beijing Normal University to a beacon of hope in her hometown of Baise is a testament to the power of determination, compassion, and unwavering dedication.
Let me paint a vivid picture of Huang Wenxiu for you. In the summer of 2019, a devastating?flash flood claimed her life. Yet, her legacy continues to?inspire?countless individuals, including myself.
Huang Wenxiu was born in 1989 and grew up in a remote mountainous village in Baise. After graduating from Beijing Normal University in 2016, Huang made a pivotal decision.?Aspiring to?break the cycle of poverty that plagued her community, she returned to her hometown instead of pursuing a career in Beijing. In 2018, Huang became the first Party secretary of Baini Village in Baise. Huang?worked tirelessly and relentlessly?to?lift?her fellow villagers?out of poverty. It took her two months to visit the 195 impoverished households scattered throughout the village. "After one year in the job, I've traveled 25,000 kilometers by car," she wrote in her work log. Huang introduced tangerine growing techniques to the village, expanded the planting area, and emphasized the importance of e-commerce sales. Thanks to Huang Wenxiu's efforts during her time in office, 418 villagers from 88 households were lifted out of poverty, with the village's poverty rate plunging from 22.88% to 2.71%. Through her actions, she?fulfilled her potential?and showed us all what it means to lead with integrity and empathy.
When I look at Huang's journey, I see resilience in the face of adversity, perseverance in the midst of hardship, and an unwavering belief in the power of community. The influence of Huang Wenxiu on my life cannot be overstated. Her story?has?fundamentally?changed the way I?view challenges and opportunities. Now, I see challenges and difficulties as an essential part of personal growth and have the courage to tackle them. I will?follow in her footsteps, not just in words but in?deeds.?Inspired by?her example, I'm compelled to seek out ways to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.?I realized that?true fulfillment comes not from personal gain but from the impact we have on the world around us.
In conclusion, as we reflect on the life and legacy of Huang Wenxiu, let us honor her memory by embracing her spirit of compassion, resilience, and selflessness. May we all strive to?follow in her footsteps?and make our own contribution to building a brighter, more compassionate world.
Thank you.
